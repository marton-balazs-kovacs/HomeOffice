# Load pacakges

```{r}

library(writexl)
```

# Import data

We noticed after the publication of the paper that the data were not shared properly, therefore we downloaded again the source datafile from Qualtrics for the pilot study and reproduced the data preprocessing for the pilot study. The newly downloaded source dataset was identical to the old one except the filename automatically generated by Qualtrics.

```{r}
source <- read_csv("Data/Pilot/Source/HomeOffice_Pilot_May+3,+2023_12.03.csv")
```

# Save labels separately

```{r}
source_label <- 
  source %>%
  slice(1:2)
```

# Renaming variables and dropping labels

```{r}
source <-
  source %>% 
  slice(-(1:2)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

# Saving benefit and downside data

```{r}
source %>% 
  select(benefit, downside) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(benefit),
         !is.na(downside),
         benefit != "",
         downside != "") %>%
  write_xlsx(., "Data/Pilot/Raw/HomeOffice_Pilot_Grouping_data.xlsx")
```

# Dropping free text variables

We did not drop the [discipline] variable but one of the authors (MK) read through all the answers and insured that they are not containing any personal information.

```{r}
source <-
  source %>%
  select(-benefit,
         -downside)
```

# Saving the dataset

```{r}
write_tsv(source, "Data/Pilot/Raw/HomeOffice_Pilot_Raw_data.tsv")
```
